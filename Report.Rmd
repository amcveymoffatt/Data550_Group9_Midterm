## Introduction

-   This is a RCT aims to compare mF75 with *currently recommended formulation of F75 among hospitalized children with SAM (Severe Malnutrition) in Kenya, Africa.*

-   *`arm1`: F75 was designed to meet the estimated nutritional requirements to restore physiological and metabolic functions and to prevent refeeding syndrome while medical conditions stabilize*

-   `arm2`: mF75(*modified F75 formula), with substantially reduced carbohydrate content and without lactose*

## Results

### Baseline Table

```{r}
baseline <- readRDS(here::here("Output/Baseline_characteristics.rds"))
knitr::kable(baseline)
```

### Primary Outcome

-   The primary outcome is time to *clinical stabilization among malnutrition infants, in which clinical stabilization refers to a child can progressing to higher protein and energy feeds to promote catch-up growth.*

-   Within 512 patients, 453 infants reach clinical stabilization, and rest of them died before censoring.

-   The Hazard Ratio is adjusted by site, gender and and breastfeeding status, but found no statistical significant in the time to clinical stabilization between two arms.

```{r}
active_config <- Sys.getenv("WHICH_CONFIG", unset = "default")
readRDS(paste0(here::here("Output/"), "primary_outcome_", active_config, ".rds"))
```

### Secondary Outcome

-   The secondary outcome is *weight.*

There was no observable difference in weight between the intervention group and the standard group.
